"""
Write Brazilian river discharge data in CSV format to a NetCDF file. 

Creates an "orthogonal" set of time series. This allows for efficient data storage, as each time series shares a single date/time variable. 
Each time series begins and ends on the same date. In the CSV files I created with the script convert_vazoes_2_csv.py, I chose to use 
the date range 1970-01-01 to 2019-12-31.

Written for Python 3.9.2
